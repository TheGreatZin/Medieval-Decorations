## About
"**Medieval Decorations**" is a Minecraft Forge mod that adds many medieval-themed decorative features to the game. The aim of the mod is to keep the Vanilla style and give it a medieval feel!
  
In the mod you can find tons of medieval-themed decorations, which can be used to decorate medieval-style homes, underground dungeons, curches and castles, inns, palaces of kings, etc. In Minecraft, the decoration choice is limited. With Medieval Decorations, players can rest assured that there will be enough decorations and diversity to satisfy their own tastes. You can find statues of knights or angels or mythical creatures, furniture of different sizes and styles, various tombstones of various shapes, barrels with different fillings and much more! Putting these decorations would make a place seem more epic and powerful. Feel free to play around and make your world more vibrant.
